Hey, whatâ€™s going on?

I am a young man who loves to learn new things, overcome challenges and solve problems, work with software development since the last 6 months, and work as a Fullstack developer.

ðŸ¤” Why Fullstack?
As I am curious and like to understand how things work it would be boring to study only the front without understanding about the back, I like to have a complete sense of everything I see.

ðŸš€ Technologies:

ðŸ’¬ My view on the market:
I believe that todayâ€™s market will not be the same as tomorrow and there will be constant changes, whoever knows how to adapt to the new and understand the real things will survive the new era of technology.
